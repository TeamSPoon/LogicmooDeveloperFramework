\section{Introduction}


TRILL (``Tableau Reasoner for descrIption Logics in Prolog'', \cite{ZesBelRig16-AMAI-IJ,Zese17-SSW-BK}) implements a tableau algorithm in
Prolog to compute the set of all the explanations of a query. 
TRILL also contains TRILL$^P$ (``TRILL powered by Pinpointing formulas''), which is able to compute a Boolean formula representing the set of explanations for a query, and 
TORNADO (``Trill powered by pinpOinting foRmula and biNAry DecisiOn diagrams'') which represent the pinpointing formula directly as a binary decision diagram, simplifying the management of the formula.
After generating the explanations, 
TRILL can computes the probability of the query. The management of the tableau rules' non-determinism is delegated to the Prolog language.

TRILL is available in two versions, one for Yap Prolog and one for SWI-Prolog. They differ slightly in the features offered.
The Yap version differs principally in the absence of the translation module form OWL/RDF to TRILL syntax and in a different management of the explanations in TRILL$^P$.

\section{Installation}
TRILL is distributed as a \href{http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=trill}{pack} of \href{http://www.swi-prolog.org/}{SWI-Prolog}. To install it, use
\begin{verbatim}
?- pack_install(trill).
\end{verbatim}
Moreover, in order to make sure you have a foreign library that matches your architecture, run
\begin{verbatim}
?- pack_rebuild(trill). 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Executing a Query with TRILL}
To run a query, you can simply load the Prolog file, for example \href{http://trill.lamping.unife.it/example/trill/peoplePets.pl}{\texttt{peoplePets.pl}}, as
\begin{verbatim}
?- [peoplePets].
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
The linked file contains axioms defined in both syntaxes accepted by TRILL, RDF/XML and Prolog Syntax, based on definition of \href{http://vangelisv.github.io/thea/}{Thea} library.
\href{http://trill.lamping.unife.it/example/trill/peoplePets.pl}{\texttt{peoplePets.pl}} is equivalent with the following KB
\begin{verbatim}
:- use_module(library(trill)).

:- trill.

:- add_kb_prefix('','http://cohse.semanticweb.org/ontologies/people#').

subClassOf(someValuesFrom('has_animal', 'pet'), 'natureLover').
subClassOf('cat', 'pet').
annotationAssertion('disponte:probability', 
        classAssertion('cat', 'Fluffy'), literal('0.4')).
annotationAssertion('disponte:probability', 
        classAssertion('cat', 'Tom'), literal('0.3')).
annotationAssertion('disponte:probability', 
        subClassOf('cat', 'pet'), literal('0.6')).
propertyAssertion('has_animal', 'Kevin', 'Fluffy').
propertyAssertion('has_animal', 'Kevin', 'Tom').
classAssertion('cat', 'Fluffy').
classAssertion('cat', 'Tom').
\end{verbatim}
\noindent


You can also load an RDF/XML file using the predicate \verb|load_owl_kb(<filename>).| in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
	\item load TRILL library\\
	\verb|use_module(library(trill)).|
	\item initialize the algorithm you want to perform inference\\
	\verb|init_trill(<algorithm_name>).|\\
	For example, if you want to use TRILL$^P$ you should run \verb|init_trill(trillp).|
	\item load the KB\\
	\verb|load_owl_kb(<filename>).|\\
	For example, \verb|load_owl_kb('./examples/biopaxLevel3_rdf.owl').|
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Now the KB is loaded and the queries can be executed in the usual way.

\subsection{Files}
The \texttt{pack/trill/prolog/examples} folder in SWI-Prolog home contains some example programs.
The \texttt{pack/trill/doc} folder in SWI-Prolog home contains this manual in latex, html and pdf.
