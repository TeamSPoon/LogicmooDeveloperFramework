@node Description
@chapter About
@section About
The purpose of this library is to provide an interface between
the Cplint@footnote{@mybibcite{Cplint}} suite and R@footnote{@mybibcite{R}}
to handle graphs made with the ggplot2@footnote{@mybibcite{ggplot2}} package.

This means that the currently available C3js@footnote{@mybibcite{C3js}}
graphing functions are also available for R.

@section Terminology
Any code between @code{<} @code{>} represents pseudocode.

The symbol @code{#} represents an unsigned integer.

Oprional parameters are encapsuled between @code{[} @code{]}.

@subsection Predicates
The following is a list of exported predicates available
for the library users'.

Please refer to the Cplint help manual for more information.

@deffn{Pita} prob_bar_r@
(:@var{Query}:atom)
The predicate computes and plots the probability of @var{Query}
as a bar chart with a bar for the probability of @var{Query} true and
a bar for the probability of @var{Query} false.
If @var{Query} is not ground, it returns in backtracking all ground
instantiations of @var{Query} together with their probabilities.
@end deffn

@deffn{Pita} prob_bar_r@
(:@var{Query}:atom@
:@var{Evidence}:atom)
The predicate computes and plots the probability of @var{Query}
given @var{Evidence}
as a bar chart with a bar for the probability of @var{Query} true and
a bar for the probability of @var{Query} false given @var{Evidence}.
If @var{Query} / @var{Evidence} are not ground, it returns in backtracking all 
ground
instantiations of @var{Query} / @var{Evidence} together with their 
probabilities.
@end deffn

@deffn{Pita} bdd_dot_string_r@
(:@var{Query}:atom,@
-@var{DotString}:string,@
-@var{LV}:list)
@end deffn

@deffn{Mcintyre} mc_prob_bar_r@
(:@var{Query}:atom,@
-@var{Probability}:dict)
?? Same as prob_bar_r ??
@end deffn

@deffn{Mcintyre} mc_sample_bar_r@
(:@var{Query}:atom,@
+@var{Samples}:int)
The predicate samples @var{Query} a number of @var{Samples} times and
plots a bar chart with a bar for the number of successes and a bar for the
number of failures.
If @var{Query} is not ground, it considers it as an existential query.
@end deffn

@deffn{Mcintyre} mc_sample_arg_bar_r@
(:@var{Query}:atom,@
+@var{Samples}:int,@
?@var{Arg}:var)
The predicate samples @var{Query} @var{Samples} times. @var{Arg} should be a variable
in @var{Query}.
The predicate plots a bar chart
with a bar for each possible value of L,
the list of values of @var{Arg} for which @var{Query} succeeds in
a world sampled at random.
The size of the bar is the number of samples
returning that list of values.
@end deffn

@deffn{Mcintyre} mc_sample_arg_first_bar_r@
(:@var{Query}:atom,@
+@var{Samples}:int,@
?@var{Arg}:var)
The predicate samples @var{Query} @var{Samples} times. @var{Arg} should be a variable
in @var{Query}.
The predicate plots a bar chart
with a bar for each value of @var{Arg} returned as a first answer by @var{Query} in
a world sampled at random.
The size of the bar is the number of samples that returned that value.
The value is failure if the query fails.
@end deffn

@deffn{Mcintyre} mc_rejection_sample_arg_bar_r@
(:@var{Query}:atom,@
:@var{Evidence}:atom,@
+@var{Samples}:int,@
?@var{Arg}:var)
The predicate calls @code{mc_rejection_sample_arg/5} and builds an R graph
of the results.
It plots a bar chart with a bar for each possible value of L,
the list of values of @var{Arg} for which @var{Query} succeeds
given that @var{Evidence} is true
The size of the bar is the number of samples
returning that list of values.
@end deffn

@deffn{Mcintyre} mc_mh_sample_arg_bar_r@
(:@var{Query}:atom,@
:@var{Evidence}:atom,@

The predicate plots a bar chart
with a bar for each possible value of L,
the list of values of @var{Arg} for which @var{Query} succeeds in
a world sampled at random.
The size of the bar is the number of samples
returning that list of values.

+@var{NBins}:int)
Draws a histogram of the samples in List dividing the domain in
@var{NBins} bins. @var{List} must be a list of couples of the form [V]-W or V-W
where V is a sampled value and W is its weight.

@section Internals
Important predicates in this library follow a common structure to avoid 
confusion and promote standardization.

Interface predicates are involved in the interaction between input data from a 
program and the plot of that same data. These predicates are usable from the 
programs.

As the name suggests, plotting predicates are only involved in plotting the 
data.

Finally there are other functions which handle the lists and other types of 
data.

@subsection Interface predicates
All interface predicates have a similar structure. Their names
end with @code{_r} in order to distinguish them from the original cplint 
predicates.

First and last operations are always @code{load_r_libraries} and 
@code{finalize_r_graph} respectively.

Plotting is done right before the last operation with one of the @code{geom_}
predicates.

A skeleton of the structure follows.
@verbatim
<cplint_graphing_predicate>_r(<input>):-
    load_r_libraries,
    <operations on the input>,
    geom_<smt>(<new input, possibly lists>),
    finalize_r_graph.
@end verbatim

@subsection Plotting predicates
Predicates directly involving plotting all start with @code{geom_} as prefix.

These predicates work with lists wich are then transformed into R data frames, 
and, as a final instruction, a corresponding plot is generated.

You can visualize the structure with the following pseudocode:
@verbatim
geom_<smt>(<Lists or other input>) :-
    <handle lists>,
    <create one or more R data frame with the lists data>,
    <rename data frame colnames to avoid using default ones>,
    <- ggplot <smt>
@end verbatim

@subsection List handling
The following predicates are used to transform a single list
containing one distribution (x and y) into a list
like @code{[r(X1,Y1), r(X2,Y2), ... , r(Xn,Yn)].}

@verbatim
r_row(X,Y,r(X,Y)).

get_set_from_list(L,R) :-
    maplist(key,L,X),
    maplist(y,L,Y),
    maplist(r_row,X,Y,R).
@end verbatim

This means that @code{R} will contain an X-Y relationship
which is then passed to an R data frame.

In case there are multiple distribution we simply have to call
@code{get_set_from_list/2} the appropriate number of times,
like: @code{get_set_from_list(<smt>,R#)}.

@subsection Main data frame creation
As descibed before, a data frame is useful to pass 
structured information between Prolog and R.

In Cplint-R in particular, we use @code{r_data_frame_from_rows/2} provided by
the Rserve Client@footnote{@mybibcite{Rserve Client}} library, in the following
manner:
@verbatim
r_data_frame_from_rows(df[#], R[#])
@end verbatim

For each distribution the optional number is incremented by one.

In case it is the last (or only) data frame then its name
will simply be @code{df}.

@subsection Helpers.
What follows are some trivial predicates indicated as helpers.

@verbatim
bin_width(Min,Max,NBins,Width) :-
  D is Max-Min,
  Width is D/NBins.

load_r_libraries :-
    <- library("ggplot2").

finalize_r_graph :-
    r_download.
@end verbatim
