To build the documentation using sphinx just type in the folder where the file(s) .rst is(are):

    > make html

Make sure you have sphinx installed it with:
    
    > sudo apt-get install python3-sphinx

You need also for the bibliography:

    > sudo apt install python3-sphinxcontrib.bibtex

To build the pdf:
    the pdf is built converting the rst file in tex and then compiling it

    > sudo apt install latexmk
    > apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended 
    
    or make sure you have installed 
    
    texlive-latex-recommended
    texlive-fonts-recommended
    texlive-latex-extra
    latexmk (this is a Sphinx requirement on GNU/Linux and MacOS X for functioning of make latexpdf)
    
    then:
    > make latexpdf
    
    or
    > make latexpdf LATEXMKOPTS="-silent"

    to have less output

    note that you maybe need to run the command two times in order to link also the bibliography
