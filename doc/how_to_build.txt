To build the documentation using sphinx just type:

    > make html

Make sure you have installed it with:
    
    > sudo apt-get install python3-sphinx

You need also for the bibliography:

    > sudo apt install python3-sphinxcontrib.bibtex    

all the biblio entries must be written without dash (-)
