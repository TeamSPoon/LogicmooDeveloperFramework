This direcory contains an implementation of the Bayesian network
search algorithm described in "Probabilistic conflicts in a search
algorithm for estimating posterior probabilities in Bayesian
networks".

The main code is in "app.tex" (this is both a Latex and Prolog file).

To load the system do 
[load]. 
in Prolog. This will load the various files. To start the search do a
start.

The following is a trace of a session:
