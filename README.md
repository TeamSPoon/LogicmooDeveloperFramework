Run-Time Checking of Assertions for Ciao and SWI-Prolog

Installation
============
To install the Run-Time checker of assertions, just follow the next sequence of
commands in your SWI-Prolog shell:

  $ swipl
  
  ?- pack_install('https://github.com/edisonm/rtchecks.git').
  true.

In Ciao the Run-Time checker is already part of the system so you
don't need extra steps to install it.
