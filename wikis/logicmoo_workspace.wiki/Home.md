* Potential Projects:

- Be great for instance we had an expert at using JNIL,
- or someone that can port ugly AllegroCL to SBCL code,
- or someone to take the STELLA-to-CommonLisp and convert it to CycLisp-to-CommonLisp,
- or someone to port nice old demos to using CYC's blackboard instead get/set-props,
- or someone to finish my CLOS<->BlackboardedCLOS,
- BlackboardedCLOS uses a prolog-like backend.


* Desiderata

- Need a Lisp, a Java, a Prolog developer at least.
- Someone understands Cyc and Schank better.  
- Email Schank saying we are implementing his SPGU-T, ask if he's interested.
- Should invite Kino as well.

* What we have

- Actually two, maybe three other people in #logicmoo do know CYC very very well.
