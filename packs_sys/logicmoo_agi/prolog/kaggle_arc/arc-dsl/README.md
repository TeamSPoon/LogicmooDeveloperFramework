# Domain Specific Language for the [Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC)

The DSL was created with the aim of being expressive enough to allow programs solving arbitrary ARC tasks, and generic, i.e. consisting of only few primitives, each useful for many tasks (see ```dsl.py```). As a proof of concept, solver programs for the training tasks were written (see ```solvers.py```).
