There is no particular legal and ethical considerations for this particular project listed in Table \ref{table:ethics_checklist}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We do not have any considerations regarding human embryos or foetuses, human participants or human cells or tissues since none of them were involved (Section1-3 in Table \ref{table:ethics_checklist}). \item The only data we used for our experiments are collected from an game environment, and none of them involved any personal data (Section 4 in Table \ref{table:ethics_checklist}). 
    \item Animals are not involved (Section 5 in Table \ref{table:ethics_checklist}).
    \item Developing countries are not involved (Section 6 in Table \ref{table:ethics_checklist}).
    \item This not project does not involve any environmental related issues or safety (Section 7 in Table \ref{table:ethics_checklist}).
    \item There is no potentials for dual use. Although this project is part of artificial intelligence in both inductive logic programming as well as reinforcement learning, it is a preliminary research and all the experiments were conducted using a game environment (Section 8 in Table \ref{table:ethics_checklist}).
    \item This project is a preliminary research and, there is no concerns regarding the misuse of applications in the foreseeable future (Section 9 in Table \ref{table:ethics_checklist}).
    \item We use only open source software, and none of them have any legal issues for the use of a research (Section 10 in Table \ref{table:ethics_checklist}).
    \item We do not have any other ethics issues regarding this project (Section 11 in Table \ref{table:ethics_checklist}).
