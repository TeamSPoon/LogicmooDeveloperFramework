There are a few different types of metaphor, each serving a different purpose.

    DONE Standard. 
   A standard metaphor is one that compares two unlike things using the basic construction X is Y.
    Shakespeare’s line “All the world’s a stage” is a standard metaphor.
    

   DONE Implied.
   An implied metaphor is a type of metaphor that compares two things that are not alike without actually mentioning one of those things. 
   For example, “A woman barked a warning at her child.” Here, the implied metaphor compares a woman to a dog, without actually mentioning the dog.
            
   Visual.
    A visual metaphor compares one thing to a visual image that suggests an association. 
   Visual metaphors are commonly used in advertising—for example, a car manufacturer picturing their latest sports car alongside an image of a panther. The metaphor is used to suggest the car is as slick, fast, and cool as the wild animal.

   DONE Extended.
    An extended metaphor is a version of a metaphor that extends over the course of multiple lines, paragraphs, or stanzas of prose or poetry. Extended metaphors build upon simple metaphors with figurative language and more varied, descriptive comparisons.

Analogy is a cognitive process of transferring information or meaning from a particular
   subject to another, or a linguistic expression corresponding to such a process.

   DONE Synecdoche is a kind of metaphor in which a part of something is used to signify 
the whole, as when a gossip is called a "wagging tongue," or when ten ships are 
called "ten sails." Sometimes, synecdoche refers to the whole being used to signify
the part, as in the phrase "Boston won the baseball game." Clearly, the entire city of 
Boston did not participate in the game; the whole of Boston is being used to signify 
the individuals who played and won the game.

   Metonymy is a type of metaphor in which 
  something closely associated with a subject is substituted for it. 
   In this way, we speak of the "silver screen" to mean motion pictures,
    "the crown" to stand for the king, 
   "the White House" to stand for the activities of the president. 
   See also figures of speech, personification, simile.

DONE An implied metaphor is a more subtle comparison; the terms being compared are not
    so specifically explained. For example, to describe a stubborn man unwilling
    to leave, one could say that he was "a mule standing his ground." 
   the man is being compared to a mule. 
   But to say that the man "brayed his refusal to leave" IS an implied metaphor,
    because the subject (the man) is never overtly identified as a mule. 
   Braying is associated with the mule, a notoriously stubborn creature, 
   and so the comparison between the stubborn man and the mule is sustained.
   Implied metaphors can slip by inattentive readers who are not sensitive to such 
   carefully chosen, highly concentrated language. 

DONE An extended metaphor is a sustained comparison in which part or all of a poem consists
    of a series of related metaphors. Robert Francis's poem "Catch" relies on an 
   extended metaphor that compares poetry to playing catch. 
   A controlling metaphor runs through an entire work and determines the form 
   or nature of that work.
