(comment SecurityProcedure "The collection of complex actions that are undertaken in an effort to
secure an individual or object.  This can be distinguished from the more general
#$ProtectingSomething in that instances of that collection can have nothing to
do with what, in English, we might call \"security procedures\".  For example, a
bystander who steps in on an impulse to defend a child from a bully may have
peformed an instance of #$ProtectingSomething, but unless his action was part of
a planned/scripted effort to stop the bully, it is not likely an instance of
#$SecurityProcedure.")
