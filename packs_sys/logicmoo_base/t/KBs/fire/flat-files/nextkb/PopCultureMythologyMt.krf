(comment Tarzan "The feral #$Superhero created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. #$Tarzan is a white male stranded in the rain forest since birth and raised by #$Apes. Consequently, he is frequently referred to as an 'ape man' or 'lord of the apes'. #$Tarzan's given birthname is Lord Greystoke, born as he was into an aristocratic English family. His female mate is lady Jane Porter. In the books of Edgar Rice Burroughs, #$Tarzan was an eloquent hero in the #$Nietzschean-Superman mold. In the movies of the 1950s and 1960s he is instead portrayed as a monosyllabic brute. (Asserted by Veale 5/12/99.)")
