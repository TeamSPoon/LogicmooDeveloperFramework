In each instance of #$Stomping, an agent violently smashes his or her #$Foot-AnimalBodyPart down on the #$Ground or #$FloorInAConstruction, or on some object resting on the ground or floor, typically making a loud noise.  Stomping may be done while walking or standing in place.  The intent of stomping on an object on the ground or floor is typically to crush, smash, or flatten it.  For instance, one might stomp on an empty plastic milk jug so that it will fit more easily in a garbage can or recycling bin.  People sometimes stomp their feet at sports and entertainment events to express #$Enthusiasm.  Stomping can also express #$Anger.")
