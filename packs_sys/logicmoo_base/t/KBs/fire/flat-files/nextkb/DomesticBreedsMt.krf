(comment DogTypeByBreedMixFn "A collection-denoting function. (#$DogTypeByBreedMixFn
?SET-OF-DOG-TYPES) denotes a collection of #$Dogs whose ancestry
includes some of each of dog types in ?SET-OF-DOG-TYPES. The set may
include some specific instances of #$DogTypeByBreed,
DogTypeByPhysicialVariety, DogTypeByFunctionalGroup, or even
#$DogTypeByBreed-Mix.  The latter is possible because breed mixes may
be specified only by approximation, referring only to the functional
type whose traits a particular #$Dog appears to have inheritied, as
when we say that some specific #$Dog must have some #$Hound in him.
For example, (#$DogTypeByBreedMixFn #$LabradorRetriever #$Poodle)
denotes the collection of dogs with mixed Lab x Poodle ancestry,
sometimes referred to as Labradoodles.  (#$DogTypeByBreedMixFn
#$HerdingDog-FunctionalGroup denotes the collection of dogs with mixed
ancestry consisting all or partly of herding dogs.")
