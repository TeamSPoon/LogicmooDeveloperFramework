 (comment mtAlternatives "For any instances MT-1 and MT-2 of
#$ReasoningWithMultiFutureMicrotheory, (#$mtAlternatives MT-1 and MT-2)
means that MT-1 and MT-2 share the same time (see
#$reasoningWithTenseMtTime) but may have different futures.
Consequently, if (#$mtAlternatives MT-1 MT-2) holds, then for each instance
PROP of #$CycFormulaWithoutFutureTrace, PROP is true in MT-1 iff PROP
is true in MT-2, but there can be some formula PROP-1 
(typically those with future tense operators as major operators) that is 
true in MT-1 but false in MT-2.")
