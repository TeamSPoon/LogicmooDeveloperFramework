(comment TheSkyAboveHere "#$TheSkyAboveHere is what

one sees when one looks up while outside, not under any trees,

shelters, umbrellas etc..  This concept does not make much sense when

#$Here is not on or near the #$groundOf #$PlanetEarth.  When the time

of the viewing location is #$DaytimeHours, #$TheSkyAboveHere is blue

and the sun is in it (unless there's a total eclispe, or it is near

sunset, sunrise etc..).  When it is nighttime, the #$TheSkyAboveHere

is black and there are stars in it.  Note that if the

#$weather of #$Here are #$CloudyArea, or if #$Here is #$Indoors-IsolatedFromOutside

the #$TheSkyAboveHere can not be seen.  #$TheSkyAboveHere is similar

to the notion of 'the heavens'.  Often #$TheSkyAboveHere is what one

refers to when one says 'the sky'.  However, see also #$SkyFn,

#$TheWholeSky, and #$PieceOfSky.")
