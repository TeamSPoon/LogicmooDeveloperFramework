 "This #$Microtheory contains rules about relations between
instances of
#$ReasoningWithTenseMicrotheory-LinearTime, which
represent a linear ordering among moments.  Note that rules in this 
microtheory amounts to semantic interpretations of formulas in 
microtheories that are instances of 
#$ReasoningWithTenseMicrotheory-SingleDateSeries, and 
thus should not be present in those microtheories.")
