(comment oughtTo-RoleInType "An instance of #$TernaryPredicate, used for tersely expressing a certain class of deontic assertions.  #$oughtTo-RoleInType relates an instance of #$IntelligentAgent, a specialization of #$Event, and an instance of #$BinaryRolePredicate, so as to express the deontic requirement that the agent play that role in an event of that type.  For example, (#$oughtTo-RoleInType Person001 #$CharitableDonation #$giver) says that Person001 ought to make a donation to some charity.  (#$oughtTo-RoleInType AGENT EVENT-TYPE ROLE) expands into (#$oughtToDo AGENT (#$relationExistsInstance ROLE EVENT-TYPE AGENT)).")
(comment mtDeonIdeal "(#$mtDeonIdeal MT-0 MT-1) means that from the point of view
of MT-0, MT-1 is considered deontically ideal --- everything ought to
be the case in MT-0 is in fact the case in MT-1, and everthing is in
fact the case in MT-1 is permissible to be the case in MT-0.  That is
to say, for each PROP, (#$oughtToBe PROP) holds in MT-0 only if PROP
holds in MT-1, and PROP holds in MT-1 only if (#$permittedToBe PROP)
holds in MT-0.")
(comment mtDeonAccessible "(#$mtDeonAccessible MT-0 MT-1) means that the contents in
MT-1 are considered deontically possible from the point of view of
MT-0.  This relation is used to carry out inference using
microtheories in an application involving deontic to-be operators.
For each such application, #$mtDeonAccessible is a universal relation
among relevant instances of #$DeonticReasoningMicrotheory.  Although
such a universal relation determines a fixed set of microtheories, the
reasoning we use such a relation is technical --- we want to take
advantage of the supported microtheory predicate #$mtConverts-Ops.")
