(comment Spiderman "The #$Superhero from the #$ComicBookSeries created by Stan Lee and

Steve Ditko in 1961. Spiderman's first appearance was in the last issue, no. 15, of 

Amazing Fantasy. #$Spiderman created a trend in #$ComicBookSeries that represented

a move away from the glossy froth of #$Superman toward a more realistic 

consideration of a character's personality and social milieu. Spidey

obtained his superpowers after being bitten by a radioactive spider, causing him

to exhibit the proportional strength of a #$Spider. He uses home-made

'web-shooters' to extrude long strands of a synthetic web-substance at high

speed, and uses these strands to fly through the cityscape in a Tarzan/vine-like

 manner.")
