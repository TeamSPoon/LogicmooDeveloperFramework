 (comment ReasoningWithTense-LogicMt-LinearDiscreteTime
 "This microtheory contains rules involving tense operators
for linear and discrete time.  That is to say, this microtheory
assumes that moments in temporal structures are ordered into not only
a strict linear ordering, but also a discrete ordering.")
