(comment performsInsAtLocType "instances of #$ExistingObjectType (and subsets of #$Agent-Generic) perform all their Actions of the given type in a location of #$ObjectType.  Invented for use *only* when location information is local to the Actor.  For example, Ballerina performs Dancing in #$ConcertHall, but Dancing may occur in lots of places.  Invented to describe Professionals but may evolve for use with other collections.  For an instance-level version of this predicate, see #$performsInsAtLocation.")
(comment worksWith "This predicate relates two agents (people or organizations) who in some way work together.  (#$worksWith AG1 AG2) means that #$Agent-Generic AG1 and #$Agent-Generic AG2 work together or cooperate in some activity for mutual benefit.  They may or may not work for the same employer (or any employer).  Some types of relationships that provide a basis for assertions using #$worksWith include:  coworkers in a company, an employee and his boss, organizations affiliated in some endeavor, a professional and her client, professionals and their representatives, a research organization and its shareholding companies, a novelist and his or her publishing company, an entertainment or arts professional and his or her agent.")
(comment ServiceEvent "A specialization of #$HelpingAnAgent.  Each instance of #$ServiceEvent is an event in which one or more agents (related to the event via the predicate #$providerOfService) do something for one or more other agents (related to the event via the predicate #$recipientOfService).  A service event may involve maintenance, repair, or refurbishing of some object belonging to the recipient(s) of the service (including care of his/her person), or it may involve gathering or transmitting information, providing advice, entertainment, transportation, etc. to the recipient(s).   Service events may or may not be done for payment.  Those done for payment are instances of #$ServiceProduct.")
(comment Training "A specialization of #$Learning and #$ServiceEvent. Each instance of this collection is an event in which some agent [#$Agent-PartiallyTangible] receives instruction in certain skills (usually, but not always, from another agent). See also #$Education, #$Teaching, #$TrainingInFn, #$TrainingForFn.")
(comment deliberateSocialParticipants "<code>(#$deliberateSocialParticipants EVENT AGENT)</code> means that the #$Agent-Generic <code>AGENT</code> has a conscious, active role in the #$SocialOccurrence <code>EVENT</code>.")
(comment taskStatus "(#$taskStatus TASK STATUS) means that an execution [see #$actionFulfillsAssignment] of TASK has the #$activityState STATUS.  The possible statuses are #$CancelledStatus, #$CompletedStatus, #$ExecutingStatus, #$InterruptedStatus, #$OngoingStatus, #$PendingStatus, and #$PostponedStatus   ")
(comment owns "A predicate that relates #$SocialBeings to things that they 
own.  <code>(#$owns AGENT OBJECT)</code> means that <code>AGENT</code> has full ownership of <code>OBJECT</code>. Thus, <code>AGENT</code> enjoys #$FullUseRights (q.v.) over <code>OBJECT</code>.  <code>OBJECT</code> might be  a physical artifact, a parcel of land, an animal, a piece of \"intellectual property\", or anything else that can be owned.  Note that, although ownership often involves control, #$owns is <i>not</i> a specialization of #$controls, as there are many exceptions.  For example, when the owner of a building leases it to someone, the former gives up almost all control over the buiding for the term of the lease.")
