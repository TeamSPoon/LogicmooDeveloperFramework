The #$USSBlueRidge has an extremely sophisticated Command and Control system. The #$JointMaritimeCommandInformationSystem (JMCIS) consists of numerous powerful computers distributed throughout the ship from which information and data from worldwide sources are entered into a central database. This single integrated database concentrates the available information into a complete tactical picture of air, surface and subsurface contacts, enabling the Fleet Commander to quickly

assess and concentrate on any situation that might arise. This ability to access information from military and civilian sources throughout the world gives Blue Ridge tremendous global command and control capability.")
