(comment UnifiedSoilClassificationSystem "The #$UnifiedSoilClassificationSystem is a standard developed by the United           States Army Corps of Engineers to identify and classify mineral and organic           soils according to their textural and plasticity qualities and on their           grouping with respect to behavior.  The various groupings of this classification           have been devised to correlate in a general way with the engineering behavior of           soils.  This correlation provides a useful first step in any field or laboratory           investigation for engineering purposes. It can serve to make some general           interpretations relating to probable performance of the soil for engineering           uses.  A detailed key to this classification system can be found at           http://www.adtdl.army.mil/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/fm/5-472/appb.htm.")
(comment NationalSoilInformationSystem "The focus of the National Cooperative Soil Survey is shifting from producing           static printed soil survey reports to providing a dynamic resource of soils           information for a wide range of needs.
