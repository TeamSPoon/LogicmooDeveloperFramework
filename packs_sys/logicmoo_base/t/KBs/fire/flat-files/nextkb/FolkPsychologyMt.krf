means that Alice regrets that she has never been married.  It entails that Alice knows that she has never been married, and that she wishes she had been married.")
(comment suspects "A #$PropositionalAttitudeSlot and specialization of #$hasOpinionAsToTruthOf.  (#$suspects AGT PROP) means that AGT suspects that PROP is true.  For example, (#$suspects Alice (#$isa Bob #$Spy)) means that Alice suspects that Bob is a spy.")

(comment AssumingSomethingToBeTrue "A specialization of #$IntentionalMentalState.  Each instance of #$AssumingSomethingToBeTrue is a situation in which some #$IntelligentAgent treats some #$Proposition as true without attempting to provide substantive epistemic support for it.

(comment HavingPropositionalAttitudeFn "A unary, reifiable #$CollectionDenotingFunction that takes a #$PropositionalAttitudeSlot PRED and returns the collection of #$IntentionalMentalStates in which an #$IntelligentAgent bears PRED to some proposition.

(comment FeelingAttribute "A specialization of #$ScalarQuantity (q.v.). #$FeelingAttribute consists of all the varying degrees of such things as #$Happiness, #$Sadness and other types of emotions. Each instance is a scalar interval that consists of a number and emotional dimension. Rarely, if ever, are these things assigned specific values or ranges of values. But if certain emotional scales came to be used and it proved useful to represent them we could easily assign numeric values to these quantities. Generally, the instances of this collection will be denoted by terms formed by applying the #$GenericValueFunctions to specializations of this collection: e.g. (#$HighAmountFn #$Anger).")
(comment ExpressingEmotionFn "A unary, reifiable #$CollectionDenotingFunction that takes an #$EmotionalQuantityType EMOTION-TYPE and returns the collection of #$Actions in which an #$Agent-PartiallyTangible expresses (an instance of) EMOTION-TYPE.  For example, (#$ExpressingEmotionFn #$Anger) is the collection of actions in which an agent expresses anger.")
(comment Rage "A #$EmotionalQuantityType.  Each instance of #$Rage is an extreme instance of #$Anger.")
(comment Like "An instance of #$EmotionalQuantityType and specialization of #$Approval.  Each instance of #$Like is some agent's feeling of affection or affinity for an agent, event, or thing.  Instances of #$Like vary depending on the intensity of the feeling, the subject experiencing the feeling, and/or the object of liking.  Specializations of #$Like include #$Affection, #$Admiration, and #$Enjoyment.")
(comment AccidentallyLeavingSomethingSomewhere "A #$FirstOrderCollection and specialization of #$Accident and #$Forgetting-Generic.

(comment ForgettingHowToDoSomething "A #$FirstOrderCollection and specialization of #$Forgetting-Generic.  Each instance of #$ForgettingHowToDoSomething is an #$Event in which an #$Agent-PartiallyTangible forgets how to do something, e.g. Alice's forgetting how to log on to her email account.")
(comment ForgettingToDoSomething "A #$FirstOrderCollection and specialization of #$Forgetting-Generic.  Each instance of #$ForgettingToDoSomething is an #$Event in which an #$Agent-PartiallyTangible forgets to do something, e.g. Bob's forgetting to turn off the stove after cooking dinner.")

(comment Forgetting-Generic "A #$FirstOrderCollection.  Each instance of #$Forgetting-Generic is an #$Event in which an #$Agent-PartiallyTangible forgets something, in some sense.

(comment Desire "A feeling of desire for something (wealth, sexual gratification, spiritual enlightenment, a piece of chocolate cake, etc.).  This is a collection; for an explanation of a typical #$EmotionalQuantityType, see #$Happiness.")
(comment agentExperiencesFeelingType "A #$BinaryPredicate that relates a #$PerceptualAgent to a #$EmotionalQuantityType.  (#$agentExperiencesFeelingType AGENT FEELING-TYPE) means that AGENT is (currently) experiencing a positive amount of FEELING-TYPE).  For example, (#$agentExperiencesFeelingType #$GeorgeWBush #$Boredom) means that, at the present moment, George W. Bush is (at least somewhat) bored.")
(comment ExperiencingSomething "A #$TemporalStuffType and specialization of #$AtLeastPartiallyMentalEvent.  Each instance of #$ExperiencingSomething is an event in which an #$Agent-PartiallyTangible (which may be an #$IndividualAgent or a #$MultiIndividualAgent) experiences or undergoes some mental or physical phenomenon.  Some examples:
<p>
A person experiencing a pain in his or her left foot.<br>
A baseball team experiencing the thrill of victory (or the agony of defeat).<br>
A dog experiencing hunger.<br>
A village (qua organization) experiencing an earthquake.<br>
A corporation experiencing a drop in sales.
<p>
An important feature of #$ExperiencingSomething is that instances of this collection are not performed deliberately (though they may be caused by other deliberate/purposeful actions); rather, they are <i>undergone</i>.  Accordingly, #$ExperiencingSomething is disjoint with (#$disjointWith) #$PurposefulAction.  Thus, e.g., no instance of #$WatchingTelevision is an instance of #$ExperiencingSomething, though of course any instance of the former will have numerous instances of the latter (e.g. experiencing certain visual images and sounds) as proper subevents.")
(comment desires "(#$desires AGT PROP) means that the #$Agent-PartiallyTangible AGT desires that the world be as the proposition PROP (represented by a #$CycLSentence-Assertible) describes it to be.  #$desires is implied by #$goals, but is weaker:  PROP might be some desirable state of affairs that the agent is not actively working, or planning, to make/keep true; e.g., world peace.
<p>
The main difference between #$desires and its specialization #$hopes, is that one can desire something that one knows to be true.  For example, a thin person can desire to be (i.e. remain) thin.  In contrast, one can hope only for what one is uncertain about.  Thus #$hopes is a specialization of #$hasEpistemicEmotion while #$desires is not.
<p>
See also #$goals and #$intends.")
(comment PrideOfAccomplishment "A #$EmotionalQuantityType.  To experience a feeling of #$PrideOfAccomplishment is to experience a feeling of #$Pride as the result of something one has accomplished.")
