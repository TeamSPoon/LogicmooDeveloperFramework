(comment Device-ProximatelyControlled "An #$ExistingObjectType.  Each instance of #$Device-ProximatelyControlled is a #$PhysicalDevice that is designed to be controlled via direct physical contact (or, at any rate, via direct physical influence from a close range, as in a toy that is operated by being blown on).  Examples: a #$Bicycle, a #$Knife, a #$LawnMower.  A #$Device-ProximatelyControlled may also be a #$Device-RemoteControlled.  A good example is the typical #$TelevisionSet, which has control buttons on the device itself as well as a #$RemoteControlDevice.
<p>
For devices that can only be proximately controlled, see the specialization #$Device-ProximatelyControlledOnly.")
