(comment limitsObservationOfFrom "(#$limitsObservationOfFrom STHG REG1 REG2) means that STHG conceals or in some manner limits the observation powers
possible from REG2 when trying to observe REG1. This predicate
embodies two aspects of the OCOKA principles, namely those of
Concealment and of Observation. (#$limitsObservationOfFrom
SmokeScreen001 GarnerValley GumbyHill) says that any object in
GarnerValley has good concealment from observation from GumbyHill,
since SmokeScreen001 prevents observation of those objects from
GumbyHill. So this predicate can be used to describe both Concealment
(in this case, from the perspective of objects in GarnerValley -- cf. also #$providesConcealmentInCOA) and
Observation (here, from the perspective of prospective observers on
GumbyHill). Whether a unit seeks to maximize concealment or
observation is based on an interaction between the METT-TC principles.
Note that if RedUnit001 occupied a position in GarnerValley and
BlueUnit001 occupies GumbyHill, it is possible to use this predicate
for something like 'SmokeScreen001 currently limits the observation of
RedUnit001 by BlueUnit001.'")

Exfiltration is conducted by friendly forces that have been encircled by enemy forces and cannot conduct a breakout or be relieved by other friendly forces. Forces returning from a raid, an infiltration, or a patrol behind enemy lines can also conduct an exfiltration. Exfiltration by an encircled force is used only as a last resort to preserve a portion of the force. It is preferable to the capture of the force. The exfiltrating force conducts it after destroying or incapacitating all equipment (less medical) not accompanying the force. The exfiltrating force may have to leave casualties in place with supplies, chaplain support, and medical attendants.")
