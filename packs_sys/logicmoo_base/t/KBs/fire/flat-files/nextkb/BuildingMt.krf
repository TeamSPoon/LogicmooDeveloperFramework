(comment ConstructionSitePropertyFn "(#$ConstructionSitePropertyFn CONSTRUCTTYPE) returns the collection of instances of #$ConstructionSite that are site for a construct of the type CONSTRUCTTYPE.  This collection represents the property a construction site has if it is a site for type CONSTRUCTTYPE.  This is a 'baptismal' property in the sense that a particular region has the property (#$ConstructionSitePropertyFn CONSTRUCTTYPE) from the moment it is designated a construction site for a construct of type CONSTRUCTTYPE, regardless of whether or not overt construction has started at the site.  It is conceivable that for some designated construction sites, construction never in fact takes place: having the property (being a member of the collection returned by this function) implies, at best, that there exists an agent who intends that construction on a construct of the kind cited will take place.")
