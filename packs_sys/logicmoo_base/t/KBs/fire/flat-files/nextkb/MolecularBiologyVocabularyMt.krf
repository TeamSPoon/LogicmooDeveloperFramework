(comment CodingSequenceConnectivity "In eukaryotic organisms, genetic sequences exhibited by all DNA and some RNA molecules have the feature that the actual coding sequence is not continuous: more specifically, the actual coding
seqence is interspersed with non-coding sequences called introns (see #$Intron-MolecularSegment) and (#$Intron-GIS).  These introns have to be excised from primary transcript RNA, and the bits and pieces of the actual coding sequence (the so-called 'exons': see #$Exon-MolecularSegment and #$Exon-GIS) stitched together by special-purpose enzymes to produce a functional messenger RNA molecule.  

#$CodingSequenceConnectivity is a collection of collections; each instance is a collection of genetic coding sequences that share the same continuity characteristic.  Most notable instances are #$CodingSequence-Interrupted and #$CodingSequence-Uninterrupted.")

(comment (ist MolecularBiologyVocabularyMt (genls RNATypeByOrganismType ExistingObjectType)) "This redundant #$genls assertion is being made to implement a short-term workaround for the RKF project, June 28, 2001.  The problem is that the immediate #$genls of this collection, #$RNAMoleculeType, is a so-called non-priming designate, and does not appear in IET images.  Thus, without the redundant link, #$RNATypeByOrganismType would appear in IET images without a #$genls. ")
