(comment GodOfAbrahamIsaacAndJacob "The supreme being worshipped in Judaism,  Christianity, and Islam.  Note that each tradition believes different things  about this deity and ascribes different historical actions to Him  (or sometimes to Her), but nearly all adherents of these faiths agree that  they do, in some sense, worship the same God.   This constant was previously named GodOfThreeMainWorldMonotheisms, but this  was thought too broad a banner for comfort. Adherents of the Judaic, Christian and Islamic traditions should recognize a common entity in  #$GodOfAbrahamIsaacAndJacob while possibly disagreeing with the belief-specific properties attributed  to this entity since the times of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  Note that this concept is defined merely as an #$Entity. The real flesh for the concept is defined in terms of sub-abstractions. Thus, the christian  subabstractions are #$GodTheFather, #$GodTheSon and #$GodTheHolyGhost. The  Islamic view is captured via the namestring 'Allah', while the Judaic view is captured view the namestring mapping 'Jehovah'.")
