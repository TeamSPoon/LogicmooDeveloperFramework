(comment OortCloud "The #$OortCloud is a vast spherical cloud surrounding the solar system and extending approximately 3 light years from the #$Sun. Within the cloud, comets are typically tens of millions of kilometers apart. Passing stars and other forces, such as giant molecular clouds, can easily change the orbits of the comets in the cloud, sending them into the inner solar system or out to interstellar space.  Estimates indicate the total mass of comets in the Oort cloud at 40 times the mass of Earth. The cloud is the source of long-period comets, such as Halley and Swift-Tuttle, that were pulled into shorter period orbits by the planets.")

(comment KuiperBelt "The ring of #$AstronomicalObjects orbiting the #$Sun outside the orbit of the #$PlanetNeptune, but inside the #$OortCloud.   The Kuiper Belt is named after Gerard Kuiper who postulated its existence in 1951. Kuiper suggested that some comets, which pass by the sun repeatedly (short-period comets), and approach the sun from within the same plane as that of the other planets, may originate in a region closer to the solar system than 100,000 AU, where the Oort Cloud is. He speculated that the region of space beyond Pluto could be populated with comets.  The first object in the Kuiper Belt was discovered in 1992, proving that Gerard Kuiper's theory of 1951 was correct. Since then many objects have been discovered in this region, which is sometimes called `trans-Neptunian space' because even the planet Pluto could really be a Kuiper Belt object.")
