(comment asymmetricMenaceWRT "This predicate is used to describe an imbalance that may contribute to one agent's actual or strategic military advantage over another.  (#$asymmetricMenaceWRT AGT1 AGT2 TYPE) means that AGT1 has an asymmetric advantage over AGT2 with respect to weapons of the type designated by TYPE, i.e., the first agent has weapons of that type, and the second agent has neither corresponding weapons of that type, nor defense systems designed to defend against such weapons. Thus, the Cyc assertion (#$asymmetricMenaceWRT #$UnitedStatesOfAmerica #$Japan #$NuclearWeapon) means that the United States has nuclear weapons, while Japan has neither nuclear weapons nor anti-nuclear weapons.  By implication, if the United States were to use nuclear weapons to attack Japan, Japan would be at a decided disadvantage.")
