(comment PartlyAssembledArtifactTypeFn "(#$PartlyAssembledArtifactTypeFn  ARTIFACTTYPE) returns the collection of artifacts whose instances are at the focal point of a process of assembly whose intended #$outputsCreated is an instance of ARTIFACTTYPE. (#$isa THING (#$PartlyAssembledArtifactTypeFn ARTIFACTTYPE)) does not mean that THING is an instance of ARTIFACTTYPE, but it does mean that if OUTPUT is an instance of ARTIFACTTYPE, and ARTIFACTTYPE is a specialization of #$Artifact, and OUTPUT is the #$outputsCreated in MAKING, and MAKING is an instance of #$Assembling, then, for the duration of any such time that it does exist in MAKING, OUTPUT is an instance of (#$PartlyAssembledArtifactTypeFn ARTIFACTTYPE).  


We don't foreclose one way or the other upon the question of whether something that is an instance of (#$PartlyAssembledArtifactTypeFn ARTIFACTTYPE) must itself be an instance of ARTIFACTTYPE, since it is anticipated that the commitment will vary with the context and the manufacturing process involved.  If THING is an instance of (#$PartlyAssembledArtifactTypeFn ARTIFACTTYPE) and is not an instance of ARTIFACTTYPE, this implies that there exists a (#$MakingFn ARTIFACTTYPE) and a performer of the making such that the performing #$Agent-PartiallyTangible intends that THING should be #$transformedInto an instance of ARTIFACTTYPE that is the #$outputsCreated of the making.  If THING is an instance of (#$PartlyAssembledArtifactTypeFn ARTIFACTTYPE) and is also an instance of ARTIFACTTYPE, this implies that there exists a (#$MakingFn ARTIFACTTYPE) in which THING is the #$objectActedOn and an assemblingAgent who intends that THING should be the #$outputsCreated of the #$Assembling.

See also the corresponding predicate #$partlyAssembledArtifactType.")
(comment partlyAssembledArtifactType "(#$partlyAssembledArtifactType ARTIFACT OBJECTCOLLECTION) holds if OBJECTCOLLECTION is the collection of objects that are in the partially assembled stage of a process whose intended #$outputsCreated is an instance of ARTIFACT.  Note that this does not imply that any instances of OBJECTCOLLECTION are instances of ARTIFACT.  See the corresponding function #$PartlyAssembledArtifactTypeFn for more information.")
