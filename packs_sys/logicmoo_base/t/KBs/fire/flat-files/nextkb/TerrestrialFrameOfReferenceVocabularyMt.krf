(comment Stratopause-PlanetEarth "Boundary layer between the #$Stratosphere-PlanetEarth and the #$Mesosphere-PlanetEarth, located at a height of approximately 50 km above the surface of #$PlanetEarth.  Exhibits some variation of temperature with latitude and season.  Considered a part of #$Stratosphere-PlanetEarth.")
(comment Mesopause-PlanetEarth "Boundary layer between the #$Mesosphere-PlanetEarth and the #$Thermosphere-PlanetEarth, located at a height of approximately 85 km above the surface of #$PlanetEarth.  Subject to strong seasonal variations of temperature at high latitudes.  Considered a part of the #$Mesosphere-PlanetEarth.")
(comment Ionosphere-PlanetEarth "Region extending from the base of the #$Mesosphere-PlanetEarth to the extent of the #$UpperAtmosphere-PlanetEarth.  Characterized as the region in which cosmic rays, UV radiation from the sun, and particle emissions from solar flares can induce ionization of atmospheric atoms.")
(comment Thermopause-PlanetEarth "Boundary layer between the #$Thermosphere-PlanetEarth and the #$Exosphere-PlanetEarth, located at a height of approximately 400 km above Earth's surface.")
(comment Baropause-PlanetEarth "Ill-defined boundary layer in the #$Exosphere-PlanetEarth beyond which frequency of collisions between atmospheric molecules is so rare that they can be considered to have their own free-space trajectories. Also known as the exobase.  Above the altitude of this layer, the atmosphere can no longer be modeled as a gas in hydrostatic equilibrium, and conventional meanings of 'temperature' and 'pressure' no longer apply.")
(comment TerrestrialFrameOfReference "The terrestrial frame of reference is the unique individual #$FrameOfReference that generally regards the surface of the #$PlanetEarth as fixed in the background space.  It permits fixed notions of #$VerticalOrientation and #$HorizontalOrientation.  There are multiple standard coordinate systems based on the #$TerrestrialFrameOfReference, including #$latitude and #$longitude, Earth-Centered Cartesian, and others.  Various local frames of reference and coordinate systems assume the #$TerrestrialFrameOfReference.")
(comment OzoneLayer-PlanetEarth "The layer of the #$Stratosphere-PlanetEarth containing the #$Ozone that protects the #$PlanetEarth against the ultraviolet rays of the #$Sun.")
(comment LowerAtmosphere-PlanetEarth "The region of #$TheEarthsAtmosphere extending from 0 km to approximately 85 km above the surface of #$PlanetEarth in most instances of #$GeographicalRegion.  It is composed of the #$Troposphere-PlanetEarth, the #$Stratosphere-PlanetEarth, and the #$Mesosphere-PlanetEarth in succession: each of these regions has a terminal zone denoted by replacing the suffix -sphere with the suffix -pause, as in, e.g., the #$Tropopause-PlanetEarth.")
(comment Stratosphere-PlanetEarth "The region of #$TheEarthsAtmosphere that lies above the #$Troposphere-PlanetEarth and below the #$Mesosphere-PlanetEarth.  Unlike the #$Troposphere-PlanetEarth, the #$Stratosphere-PlanetEarth is characterized by an increase of temperature with altitude, steady at the lower levels and rapidly increasing at the upper boundary.  The #$Stratosphere-PlanetEarth and the #$Troposphere-PlanetEarth are clearly separated, with atmospheric exchange requiring months or years to take place. The #$Stratosphere-PlanetEarth extends from 6-17 km to approximately 50 km above the surface of #$PlanetEarth.")
(comment Mesosphere-PlanetEarth "The region of #$TheEarthsAtmosphere lying above the #$Stratosphere-PlanetEarth and below the #$Thermosphere-PlanetEarth.  It is characterized by a rapid decrease in temperature, with the upper limit, the #$Mesopause-PlanetEarth, being characterized by the zone of minimal temperature.  Like the #$Stratosphere-PlanetEarth, its height is subject to seasonal variation, but it extends on average from a height of 50 km to a height of 85 km above the surface of #$PlanetEarth in most regions.")
(comment UpperAtmosphere-PlanetEarth "The region of #$TheEarthsAtmosphere extending from approximately 85 km above the surface of #$PlanetEarth to 700 km or more.  It is composed successively of the #$Thermosphere-PlanetEarth and the #$Exosphere-PlanetEarth.")
(comment Exosphere-PlanetEarth "Outermost layer of #$TheEarthsAtmosphere, extending from approximately 400 km to 700 km above the surface of #$PlanetEarth.  In the #$Exosphere-PlanetEarth, the atmosphere is increasingly attenuated, to the point where atoms and molecules are no longer considered to relate to each other in a gaseous state but are instead considered to be following free-space trajectories.  At the outer boundaries of the lies near-Earth space, a region which for most intents and purposes can be modeled as a vacuum or near-vacuum.")
(comment Tropopause-PlanetEarth "The upper region of the #$Troposphere-PlanetEarth, located at an altitude that varies from 17 km at the #$EarthsEquator to 6-8 km at the poles.  The #$Tropopause-PlanetEarth marks the boundary between #$Troposphere-PlanetEarth and the #$Stratosphere-PlanetEarth but is properly considered part of the #$Troposphere-PlanetEarth.")
(comment Troposphere-PlanetEarth "The layer of #$TheEarthsAtmosphere immediately in contact with the surface of #$PlanetEarth.  Most of the weather of #$PlanetEarth:  fronts, hurricanes, rainstorms, and so forth, occurs in this layer.  The upper limit of the #$Troposphere-PlanetEarth, called the #$Tropopause-PlanetEarth, is located at an altitude of about 17 km at the #$EarthsEquator, and varies to a height of only 6-8 km at the poles.  The height in a given region is partially dependent on local weather conditions, depending on whether a high-pressure or low-pressure region predominates.  Temperature in #$Troposphere-PlanetEarth decreases gradually with height.  Most terrestrial organisms cannot survive unaided above this region.")
(comment Thermosphere-PlanetEarth "The region of #$TheEarthsAtmosphere that lies above the #$Mesosphere-PlanetEarth and below the #$Exosphere-PlanetEarth, extending from a height of approximately 85 km above the surface of #$PlanetEarth to more than 400 km above Earth's surface.  Temperature in this region increases gradually until one reaches the #$Thermopause-PlanetEarth, and is isothermal thereafter.")
