(comment WinSock "#$WinSock is short for (\"Windows Sockets\"). It is used as the interface between TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol --     see #$TCP-IP), and Windows. Today's most popular #$Internet applications for Microsoft Windows (see #$MSWindows) and IBM OS/2 are developed according to the #$WinSock standard.")
(comment ServerMessageBlockProtocol "#$ServerMessageBlockProtocol (\"SMB\") is an application layer resource-sharing protocol. SMB clients connect to SMB servers using TCP/IP, NetBEUI, or IPX/SPX.  Clients establish connections over SMB to request access to shares, files, printers, mailslots, API's, etc.")

(comment FileTransferProtocol "A client-server communication protocol which allows a user on one computer to transfer files to and from another computer over a TCP/IP network.")
(comment TrivialFileTransferProtocol "The Trivial File Transfer 

protocol (\"TFTP\") is a simple protocol to transfer files. It is designed to 

be small and easy to implement, so its implementations lack most of the 

features of regular #$FileTransferProtocol implementations. It uses the #$UserDatagramProtocol (UDP) and can only 

read or write files from remote servers -- it cannot list directories, and 

currently has no provisions for user authentication. It is often used by servers 

to boot diskless workstations, X-terminals, and routers.")
(comment NetBEUI "#$NetBEUI, #$NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface, is a combined 
#$NetworkLayerProtocol and #$TransportLayerProtocol that is an enhancement of the 
	#$NetBIOS protocol used by various IBM and Microsoft network operating
	systems such as LAN Manager, LAN Server, etc. NetBEUI does not provide
routing, so it can only transport data between machines in the same LAN. Two
LANs that run NetBEUI can be connected with a bridge, but another 
NetworkLayerProtocol must be used in addition to NetBEUI in order to access
the #$Internet. ")

IP multicasting specification. IGMP messages are encapsulated in IP datagrams, with an IP protocol number of 2.")
(comment PostOfficeProtocol "The #$NetworkProtocol implemented by instances of #$POPServerProgram and #$POPClientProgram. The Post Office Protocol (POP) was designed to support offline mail processing. That is, the client connects to the server to download mail that the server is holding for the client. The mail is deleted from the server and is handled offline (locally) on the client machine.  #$POP3Protocol and #$POP2Protocol are subsumed by #$PostOfficeProtocol.")
(comment Gopher-InternetProtocol "A once-popular distributed document retrieval system which started as a Campus Wide Information System at the #$UnivOfMinnesota. Gopher servers provide a menu of documents, which may be plain text files, sound or image files, submenus, or other Gopher object types. They may be stored on other hosts, and may provide the ability to search through certain files for a given string. #$Gopher-InternetProtocol has been largely superceded by the #$WorldWideWeb-DynamicIndexedInfoSource, which includes access to Gopher documents as one of its access schemes, but also includes html, which has the ability to combine images, sound, and text on a single page.")

nested mailboxes as well as resynchronization with the server.")
(comment LightweightDirectoryAccessProtocol "A protocol for updating and searching on-line directory services over #$TCP-IP. LDAP defines a directory format that arranges entries containing email addresses, photographs, and other information about individuals (whether they are in stand-alone directory servers or in X.500 directories) in a hierarchical tree structure. These directories can be accessed over the Internet to retrieve information or edit information that the user has access to. Large organizations such as universities use LDAP for online 'phone books' containing publicly available information about students and staff.")
