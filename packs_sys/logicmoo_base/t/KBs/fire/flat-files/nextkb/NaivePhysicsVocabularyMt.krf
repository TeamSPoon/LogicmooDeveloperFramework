To illustrate, consider a tire hanging by a rope from a tree branch.  To say that the rope has an #$InternalTension of 10 newtons upward (or equivalently, downward) is to say that the top half of the rope is exerting 10 N of upward force on the bottom half, and the bottom half is exerting 10 N of downward force on the top half.

If it is supported by anything, that thing is #$Airborne and it is not `inside' (contained in?) whatever is supporting it. Thus airplanes flying, soap bubbles floating, or people jumping in midair are classic positive exemplars of #$Airborne things.  Slightly more questionable positive exemplars include people suspended by parachutes, or the jet engines hanging off an #$Airborne 747, or the clothes of a sky diver.  Negative exemplars include the people inside such an aircraft, chewing gum inside a skydiver's mouth because they are contained in something airborne.  A person hanging from a bungee jumping chord is not airborne because the bungee chord is inevitably supported by `the ground'.  However, while floating downward on a slack bungee tether, said jumper would be considered #$Airborne since he is not supported by anything, but rather in free fall.")
