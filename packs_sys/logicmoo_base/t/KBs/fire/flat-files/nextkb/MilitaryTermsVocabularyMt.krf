defensive.")

(comment MilitaryInvasion "A specialization of #$MilitaryOperation.  Each instance of #$MilitaryInvasion is a planned military invasion of some territory; the territory invaded is related to the invasion by the predicate #$objectActedOn (q.v.).  See also the collection #$MilitaryOccupation.")
(comment MilitaryOperation "A specialization of #$MilitaryEvent.  Each instance of #$MilitaryOperation is a planned military operation.  Instances of   #$MilitaryOperation usually require organization and coordination, and often are complex activities.  For large-scale military operations involving several groups of agents, see the specialization #$MilitaryOperation-Joint.  Examples of  #$MilitaryOperation include the attack on Pearl Harbor and the retaking of Bunker Hill.")

(comment MilitaryAction "The collection of all military tasks such as might be assigned to deployable, modern military units.  A particular task is performed by one and only one unit, although other units may function in a support capacity, and subunits of the performing unit may be assigned tasks that figure as subtasks of the performing unit's assigned task.  In this case the tasks of the subordinate units should be related to the overarching task of the superior unit by the #$subTasks relation.  A single unit may be assigned more than one task.  Notice that this collection is a specialization of #$MilitaryEvent, not #$MilitaryOperation complex events take account of both primary tasks and their subtasks and also distinct support tasks.  Instances of #$MilitaryAction may properly figure as #$subEvents in an instance of #$MilitaryOperation.")
(comment MilitaryTask-Offensive "The collection comprised of the closed class of offensive forms of #$MilitaryAction.  The collection is not a specialization of #$MilitaryAttack or #$AttackOnTangible, since not all forms of #$MilitaryTask-Offensive constitute outright attacks.  Some instances may be attacks, however.")
(comment MilitaryAttack "The collection of all instances of #$MilitaryEvent that are also considered to be instances of #$AttackOnTangible. The characteristics that define a military 'attack' are somewhat loose: military units are involved, deadly force is involved, and the event in question is of an immediately 'offensive' character (although an attack can be a #$subEvents in the course of either a 'defensive' or 'offensive' #$MilitaryEvent). Instances may be complex events: that is, they may involve more than just physical attack events and may include a measure of planning and preparation.")
(comment MilitaryTaskedActionType "The collection of all types of #$PurposefulAction that can be
assigned as tasks (cf. #$unitAssignedToTask) to a military unit (cf.
#$ModernMilitaryUnit-Deployable).  Examples of instances of
#$MilitaryTaskedActionType are #$AttackOnObject and
#$PhysicalDestructionEvent.  It is not assumed that any spec whatsoever
of #$MilitaryAction is an instance of #$MilitaryTaskedActionType : e.g., the
collection of tasks to be performed by UNIT003 by 3 pm on July 31 might
well be a spec of #$MilitaryAction, but it shouldn't be a military task
_type_ in its own right. (In other words: this collection does not include
the powerset of #$MilitaryAction.)")

primarily on the ground.  The force may travel to area of operation
via air or sea routes, but their mission-related tasks are done on
land.")

(comment ShootingAttack-Gun "An instance of #$AttackType and a specialization of (#$AttackTypeByWeaponTypeFn #$Gun).  Each instance of #$ShootingAttack-Gun is an attack in which at least one agent shoots a #$Gun to inflict damage on someone or something.  #$ShootingAttack-Gun is a <i>proper</i> specialization of (#$AttackTypeByWeaponTypeFn #$Gun), since the latter collection includes attacks in which a gun is (e.g.) thrown or used as a club.")
(comment MortarAttack "An instance of #$AttackType.  Each instance of #$MortarAttack is an #$AttackOnTangible in which at least one of the weapons used is a #$MortarLauncher.")

(comment PoisoningAttack "An instance of #$AttackType and a specialization of #$AttackOnTangible.  Each instance of #$PoisoningAttack is an attack in which an agent attempts to hurt or kill another agent by (somehow) getting that agent to ingest a #$ToxicSubstance.  For #$PoisoningAttacks in which an agent intends to kill another agent, use the more specialized collection #$AttemptingKillingThroughPoisoning.")
