 (comment ReasoningWithTense-LogicMt-LinearDenseTime
 "This microtheory contains rules involving tense operators
for linear and dense time.  That is to say, this microtheory assumes
that moments in temporal structures are ordered into not only a strict
linear ordering, but also a dense ordering.")
