Mine arming begins when the dispenser opens. Mine detonation is initiated by target detection, mine disturbance, low battery voltage, and a self-destruct time-out. The antitank mine is a magnetic sensing submunition effective against tanks and armored vehicles. The antipersonnel mine has a fragmenting case warhead triggered by trip wires. The US Air Force employed 1,105 CBU-89s during the Gulf War.  The Gator mine system provides a means to emplace minefields on the ground rapidly using high-speed tactical aircraft.  The minefields are used for area denial, diversion of moving ground forces, or to immobilize targets to supplement other direct attack weapons.")

The LLLGB was developed in response to Sophisticated enemy air defenses, poor visibility, and to counter limitations in low ceilings. The weapon is designed for low altitude delivery and with a capability for improved standoff ranges to reduce exposure. The GBU-24 LLLGB/Paveway III has low-level, standoff capability of more than 10 nautical miles. Performance envelopes for all modes of delivery are improved because the larger wings of the GBU-24 increases maneuverability.

The DB mustard gas blister agent is added and the burster well is then press-fit into the fuze adapter followed by the M5 tetrytol burster being installed into the burster well. A fuze well cup, made of either aluminum or Bakelite, is installed by first coating the lower interior threads of the fuze adapter with sealing compoudn or cement and then screwing the cup down into the fuze adapter. The M60 is then closed by screwing on an M57 or M51A5 point detonating fuze and staking it in place. Staking is an operation in which a punch is used to deform the metal of the fuze so that the metal is pushed into a notch in the projectile body, thereby locking the threaded joint. The projectiles are stored 24 per wooden pallet with 2 pallets butted together with steel banding.")

In long-range engagements AMRAAM heads for the target using inertial guidance and receives updated target information via data link from the launch aircraft. It transitions to a self-guiding terminal mode when the target is within range of its own monopulse radar set. The AIM-120 also has a \"home-on-jam\" guidance mode to counter electronic jamming. With its sophisticated avionics, high closing speed, and excellent end-game maneuverability, chances of escape from AMRAAM are minimal. Upon intercept an active-radar proximity fuze detonates the 40-pound high-explosive warhead to destroy the target. At closer ranges AMRAAM guides itself all the way using its own radar, freeing the launch aircraft to engage other targets.")
