(comment ksSiblingKS "(#$ksSiblingKS KNOWLEDGE-SOURCE SIBLING) means that KNOWLEDGE-SOURCE inherits all #$ksImportationTemplate and #$ksTermString assertions from SIBLING. Essentially, KNOWLEDGE-SOURCE inherits all of SIBLING's terms and templates. This is different than '(#$genlMt KNOWLEDGE-SOURCE SIBLING); the knowledge source assimilation code utilizes information specific to a knowledge source's siblings but not its #$genlMt's. Note that the inheritance is not recursive; (#$ksSiblingKS KNOWLEDGE-SOURCE SIBLING) and (#$ksSiblingKS SIBLING OTHER-SIBLING) does not imply (#$ksSiblingKS KNOWLEDGE-SOURCE OTHER-SIBLING). (Maybe it should?)")

This predicate is to replace #$ksSiblingKS.")
