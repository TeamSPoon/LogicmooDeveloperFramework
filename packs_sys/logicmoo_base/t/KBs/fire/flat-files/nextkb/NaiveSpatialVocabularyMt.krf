(comment nextToLike-Horizontally "A #$RelativeLocationalPredicate and specialization of #$nextToLikeObjects (q.v.).  (#$nextToLike-Horizontally OBJ1 OBJ2 TYPE) is true just in case (#$nextToLikeObjects OBJ1 OBJ2 TYPE) and, additionally, the bottom of OBJ1 is not #$above-Generally the top of OBJ2, or vice versa.

(comment lateralShiftFootprintRegion "A predicate relating an object to the space it would occupy
if it shifted one entire footprint to the left or right.
(#$lateralShiftRegion STHING DIRFN LAT-REGION) means that the
#$GeographicalRegion LAT-REGION is adjacent to (#$FootprintOfObjectFn
STHING) in the direction denoted by (DIRFN STHING), and has the same
area as (#$FootprintOfObjectFn STHING).  If STHING were to shift one
footprint in that direction, it would occupy LAT-REGION.")
(comment FootprintOfLateralShiftFn "(#$FootprintOfLateralShiftFn STHING DIRFN) denotes the region
LAT-REGION adjacent to the current (#$FootprintOfObjectFn STHING) in the direction denoted by (DIRFN ?STHING) by one footprint. For example,
(#$FootprintOfLateralShiftFn #$TheWhiteHouse #$LeftwardsFn) denotes
the region to the left of the White House (where left is defined by
the White House's orientation), adjacent to the space currently
occupied by the White House, and the same size as the currently
occupied space.  It is the space the White House would occupy if it
were shifted one-whole-White-House-footprint to its left. The
predicate corresponding to this function is #$lateralShiftFootprintRegion.")
