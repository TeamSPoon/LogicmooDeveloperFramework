;; The relation definitions below are a bit wordy and may seem awkwardly defined.
;; But, they need to be defined in terms of sketched arrows.  They need to be defined
;; so that it makes sense when the first argument is at the tail of the arrow and
;; the second argument is at the head.  They also need to be specific enough to 
;; be able to represent a specific relationship with just two arguments.  Usually
;; this is done with Events and Role Relations, but since that representation
;; doesn't quite work with sketches (it would be weird to draw an Event glyph separate
;; from its participants), I am using the relations defined below. [MDC 6/10/2012]
