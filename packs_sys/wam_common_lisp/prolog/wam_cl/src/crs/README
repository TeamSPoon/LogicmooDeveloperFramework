This directory contains the components of the Common Runtime Support:

1. memory management (files gbc.c alloc.c)
2. dumping an image (files unex*.c and unixsave.c)
3. dynamic loading (dld.c)
4. networking support (tcp.c)

These are built into a library (libcrs.a) which is searched when
building a Lisp application.

Implementations of unexec for various architectures is provided.
Some of them are those provided with GNU Emacs.
However we cannot use for instance unexsunos4, which expects a dynamic
linked executable, since this prevents subsequent loading of files
(procedures such as memcpy and _setjmp do not appear in the load map).

As a fall back we use unixsave.c, which works for all Suns, HP9000/300,
Vax, DOS/go32, Apollo, IBM/RT, Sequent.
