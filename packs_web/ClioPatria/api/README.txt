---+ ClioPatria APIs

An API is an  HTTP  handler   with  accompagnying  predicate, but unlike
applications   (see   ../applications),   APIs     are    targetted   on
machine-to-machine  interaction.  The  response-type  from   an  API  is
typically either XML or JSON.

The choice between XML and  JSON   is  sometimes described by standards.
JSON is often  the  preferred  format  if   the  intended  client  is  a
web-browser (using AJAX interaction).
