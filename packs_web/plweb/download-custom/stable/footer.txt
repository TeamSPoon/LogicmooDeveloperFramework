## SWI-Prolog version 8

The SWI-Prolog 8.0 major  release  marks   mostly  a  milestone  for the
internals, stability, deployment options  and   maintainability  of  the
system. SWI-Prolog extensions  and   incompatibilities  wrt. traditional
Prolog are described in [extensions](</pldoc/man?section=extensions>).

SWI-Prolog 8.2 notably brings much of   the  advanced tabling support of
XSB  to  SWI-Prolog:  Well  Founded    Semantics,   restraints  (bounded
rationality), incremental tabling and  shared   tabling.  It  also makes
rational numbers primary citizens. Using   Google's tcmalloc reduces the
memory footprint drastically on some multi-threaded workloads.
