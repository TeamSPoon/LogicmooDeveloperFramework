### Should I use the development release or the stable one?

Many active SWI-Prolog users  track  the   development  releases  or GIT
versions for developing Prolog  applications.  Most   of  the  time  the
development versions are fairly stable.   Infrequent  larger rewrites to
the  core  infrastructure  that  may   cause  instability  is  typically
announced on the mailinglist.

Tracking the latest version offers some advantages for you are user:

  - Bug fixes are quickly available.
  - When you are stuck on a missing feature you can use this quickly
    after it has been added.
  - Although you are a little more often confronted with
    incompatibilities and regressions, such issues can be discussed and
    resolved.
